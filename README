Things to know:
  First command line argument (other than executable) is vehicle inventory input file
  second argument is person directory input file (given in lab 7)
  third argument is file of names to remove for extra credits

  When you enter an ID that is invalid for selecting a vehicle, it seems like
  nothing happens, but when you print the inventory again to show the options
  again, they print to the same place on the terminal so it looks like I did
  not put in a message saying that the ID is invalid. Scroll up on the terminal
  and it'll be there.

  I honestly didn't run into a ton of problems. I understand inheritance
  well enough that it didn't confuse me. It just took a long time with how
  large of a program it is.

  I think it is a good assignment. I know the summer sessions aren't as
  conducive to this as other semesters but having these due at the end
  of the week would allow students to have office hours the entire week
  before instead of just one day. Most people wouldn't have enough of
  the program finished to need help by Friday afternoon.
